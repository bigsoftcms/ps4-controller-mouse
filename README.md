# PS4 Controller to Mouse

Make PS4 controller (Dualshock 4) into computer mouse with Python

## Feature
- Left stick to move mouse pointer
- Right stick to scroll
- Circle button to click

## Dependency

- Python 3
- pyglet https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet
- pynput https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput

## FYI
I tried https://github.com/ArturSpirin/pyPS4Controller on my iMac but it didn't work, because OS X doesn't support SPP for wireless controller. It seems like only working on Linux.
